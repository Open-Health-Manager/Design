# Research Plan for Rosie, Open Health Manager, 04/25/2022

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
- Where is your product situated?
- Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

### User Journey
Where does Rosie fit into the user journey?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- these should go in the conversation-guide.md file.

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Examples of common research methods include: 
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
- Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research
- Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design 
- Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release

### Location
Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research.

If remote, include your preferred video conferencing software. Choice of: Zoom, GoTo Meeting; WebEx.

If in person, include:
- Location
- Point of contact
- Equipment used for research

### Research materials

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	

Participant recruitment info goes here.

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Inclusive recruiting](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-a-better-future-with-inclusive-user-research-fb6a2a1c7c73)

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. patients, doctors, community health workers), and how will you recruit them? 

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (doctors, patients, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. 

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
When will things happen? What's the schedule?

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions
How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled?
