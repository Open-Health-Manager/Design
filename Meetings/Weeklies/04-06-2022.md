# Weekly Design Open Health Manager (OHM) Meeting Notes, 04/06/2022

## Summary

- Discussed working group staffing plan
- Developed project priority tasks for next 6-8 weeks

## To-do

Three priorities

### 1. Group staff plan - staffing and how to go about it

- open source project
    - GoInvo 1.25 FTE commitment
        - April-June
        - Matthew 0.7-0.8
        - Juhan 0.15 - 0.2
    - MITRE
    - User groups?
        - how do we get pt feedback on what they want in a health manager?
        - started inside MITRE, although potential for PHI contamination/breach, so MITRE won't be running that user group
        - fine for MITRE to attend, but not to run it
        - external connections might be available, Jessica working to set up those connections for a user group

### 2. What are we actually doing - vision of the project articulated through design

- Visual document/ task-list
- Design priorities for next 6 weeks:
    - Patient care plan (CPE - care plan experience)
        - view: what does the patient actually see here?
        - how it evolves over time
    - Data aggregation from n sources
        - see the integration (where's all this coming from?)
            - clinics, sensors, manual input
    - Sharing Module
        - how do my family/friends/community access my health data for my benefit
        - sharing the data with various services (specialists, PCP, apple health, various APIs)
            - generate a care plan without immediate PCP input?
            - get UX right - what are we doing with your data, for how long, who you're sharing that data with, and how does it benefit the patient?
    - Updating data
        - voice/input (12s or under of updating data)
        - optimize to quickly update data (10s or less)
        - CDS - clinical data service/support
    - user group feedback loops (not actionable yet)
- stub these 4 priorities in the design github repo
- stub in longer term
        
#### Thoughts on project goals:

How do we get someone interested in their health data? How do we get them to fix/work on it? More public version of a CDS. Tackle technical aspects first, then adjust as the user groups/FIU info becomes available.

How do we get people to start taking action/thinking about their health?


### 3. Project rhythm

When do we meet do design? Co-design? When do the designers and engineers meet/review?

    - what's the schedule for deliverables from different teams/members?
    - these three things should be on github
    - Caroline available mostly Fridays, 2-week sprints, AGILE
        - 2 hour design group w/ Matthew
    - Dev team available Monday mornings for design review
    - Team leads meet tuesday mornings for project info
        - sync-up of all MITRE projects for digital health horizon strategy on Wednesdays
    - front-end developer availability to be involved in design
        - sync up MITRE (Brandon) dev with Caroline/Matthew
    - involving people outside of the immediate team
        - Monday meeting
